## Important!
Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:
```
VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY=WmxF2yhGtYOPessOgJxXwNk83EzhcI3osetf2eajcW0cEbbyNW5kJT4E
```
I know this isn't the safest way to share an API key, but it's included here so you can test the project. Feel free to replace it with your own key if needed.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running Tests
